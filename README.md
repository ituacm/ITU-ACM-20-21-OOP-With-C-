### Prerequisities
1. Basic knowledge about programming in C or C++
  * Data types, functions, header files
  * Pointers, arrays
  * Structs (not necessarily but will help)
2. Any C++ IDE or any text editor + compiler combo would work
3. A Zoom account

### Lecture Day and Time
Every Wednesday, [ 18:00 - 19:30 ] (Online)

### Goal

In this program we will learn about OOP using C++. The goal of this course is to learn techniques of abstraction via OOP to make programs more managable as they get larger. This course will cover classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exceptions and introduction to modern C++ tools.
